**Through Seven Seas** was a mare foaled on April 8, 2018. She was sired by **Dream Journey** and **Slew All**,whose sire was **Kurofune**.

She was the winner of the RC Laurel Sho (aka the Queen Stakes), came second by a neck to Equinox in the 2023 Takarazuka Kinen, and won 4th place at Prix de  L'arc the Triomphe in 2023. 

While Through Seven Seas was not a conventionally impressive racehorse by *Umamusume* standards, she and the people who were part of her career inspire me

## Trivia

* Her most frequent jockey was **Christophe Lemaire**, who also rode her at the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe.
