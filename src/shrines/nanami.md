**Through Seven Seas** was a mare foaled on April 8, 2018. She was sired by **Dream Journey** and her dam **Slew All**. Her damsire was **Kurofune**.

She was the winner of the RC Laurel Sho (aka the Queen Stakes), came second by a neck to Equinox in the 2023 Takarazuka Kinen, and won 4th place at Prix de  L'arc de Triomphe in 2023. 

While Through Seven Seas was not a conventionally impressive racehorse by *Umamusume* standards, she and the people who were part of her career inspire me to remember that no matter how "small" my achievements may be, I am still worthy of recognition for trying.

Unlike her father, Dream Journey, Through Seven Seas lacked the temperament issues that most of Stay Gold's bloodline is known for. Rather, she was a very hard worker and very well-behaved. She especially seemed to enjoy putting in more effort when people were watching her.
