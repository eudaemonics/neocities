This is a loose summary of stuff I've read, watched, played, listened to, etcetera over the year of 2025. Honestly kind of a rough year for  me, but I figured it'd be better to aggregate the stuff I've been doing somewhere than to never do it at all. I do this analog-style in my Hobonichi weeks too. This is loosely organized chronologically.

## *BanG Dream! Ave Mujica: The Die is Cast* (Anime)

Genuinely amazing psychological horror anime that really innovates on *BanG Dream's* established formula all "merry bad end" style. Not only is Ave Mujica such a powerful musical/theater act, it packs a punch with its incredible scriptwriting and direction. It is the perfect continuation to its predecessor <em>MyGO!!!!!</em> and emblematic of gothic horror and literature.

I had to dock a point unfortunately for the incest plot twist. I mostly don't think it was revealed *especially* elegantly and it could have used a little more foreshadowing. I like Uika as a character and think she's fascinating because of the twist, though.

A really incredible feat of television. The scriptwriting and comedy reminded me a lot of a childhood favorite, *Pushing Daisies*. Unfortunately, I found the 2nd season to be very weak compared to the first season.

The first time I've ever seen an RPGMaker game actually utilize the "RPG" part of the engine. The combat in this game was fun and addictive, but it got repetitive after a point and many objectives were telegraphed very poorly to the player. I *did* find the final act incredibly compelling though. Even though the characters are a bit one-note and I have qualms with the way the developer treats some of the game's open-endedness, it's a worthwhile experience.

I did find the plot twist of Loop being Siffrin a little <em>too</em> obvious. Additionally there are a lot of little stray hints that feel like they tie into the main plot but are extraneous, I would've liked it better if they were telegraphed as being separate.

## *deltarune* Chapters 3-4 (Game)

Extremely difficult to rate this as *deltarune* is literally *not a finished game*, but I loved chapters 3 and 4. They give a lot of excellent insight into the characters and the events that are going to unfold in the future without getting too bogged down by obtrusive metanarrative elements. Noelle has skyrocketed to the top of my favorite characters of all time list.

An interesting read, at least  for someone who has DID. I think this is a hard recommendation for people who don't have C-PTSD orexperience splitting at all.

Everything I ever wanted from a sequel  to *Hollow Knight* and then more. Probably the perfect game with perfect gameplay, exploration, combat, music, and story.

A really interesting little murder mystery short story. I recommend it highly to anyone looking for a short story to add to their to-read list.

I wanted to like this movie more, but sadly it really...didn't give me a reason to? It was just fine, really, but it's very vibes-based and there isn't a real "takeaway" to be had after I watched this film.

This film has, very frankly, <em>not</em> aged well but it is a VERY good watch. Looking forward to watching <em>Wake Up, Dead Man</em>.

This kinetic novel is really special, even if it's only 8 hours long. I don't think it's groundbreaking or anything, but I've never seen my (contradictory) philosophy of unconditional love so clearly reflected in a fictional character before.

The first show I have ever watched by Vince Gilligan. I think the conceit of this show is elevated *so* much by making the main character a lesbian.

I really liked the first game, so I <em>obviously</em> loved the second one too. I think the addition of the new Snake and Boxing styles were a really smart addition and made the street fights easier to get through... I think the story progression was a little bit weird though? It felt like the first 5-6 chapters were really slow, but I saw the plot twists pretty early on. This game also has *so* much content that I'm unsure if we'll really see all of it, but I enjoyed it anyway.
