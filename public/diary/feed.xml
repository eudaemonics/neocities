		<title>Specks of Time</title>
		<description>First blog post, hurrah!
Iâ€™ve written blog posts on things like Tumblr before, but this feels like a step into a new world. Very grateful to have discovered zonelets and roccie which helped me figure out how to set up this little subsection of my website.</description>

		<description>It sure has been a while since I last updated... Fun fact, I wrote this in January, but I cut my finger so I had to wait a while for it to heal.</description>

		<title>2024 Yearly themes</title>
		<description>Wow, it's been a while since I updated huh? I think I pushed out an update before I got to write up this blog post while I was testing deploy to neocities. At least if everything was working correctly.</description>

		<title>Making a site in RStudio</title>
		<description>I've been hyperfixating like crazy on updating my site because apparently using a data science IDE to try and make a somewhat customized site is like a puzzle to my brain?</description>

		<title>Ditch Google Docs and Get a Blog</title>
		<description>Soooo writing (fan)fiction and working on some of my interactive fiction projects has been hard. So here I am with another brain dump-y post that I was finally spurred into writing because of a lovely essay I saw on Twitter about butch and gnc girls in Japanese idol games...which I lost track of.</description>

		<title>Weeknotes 001</title>
		<description>Wanted to attempt doing my version of weeknotes, but so I'll see if this is really useful or not... This was originally posted on my mataroa blog which I use for my professional life, but I realized I'd rather post them here. It gives me more of a reason to use neocities!</description>
