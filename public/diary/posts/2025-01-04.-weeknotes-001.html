<h1>Weeknotes 001</h1>
<h4>4 January 2025</h4>
<p>Wanted to attempt doing my version of <a href="https://doingweeknotes.com/">weeknotes</a>, but so I'll see if this is really useful or not... This was originally posted on my <a href="mataroa.blog">mataroa</a> blog which I use for my professional life, but I realized I'd rather post them here. It gives me more of a reason to use neocities!</p>
<h2>Life</h2>
<ul>
<li>Celebrated my birthday on December 27th. It was very lowkey, as usual with my family and my birthday being during the holidays.</li>
<li>Got sick on December 30th with a sore throat. Slowly recovering as I write this, but it's really these unidentifiable things that get you!</li>
<li>Doing a lot of New Year's cleaning and planning, still working out that yearly theme.</li>
<li>Been successfully doing &quot;one line a day&quot; journaling for most days since December 30th. I'm trying a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vEBBYJ1WBk&amp;t=586s&amp;pp=ygUTZG9wYW1pbmUgam91cm5hbGluZw%3D%3D">system</a> for my monthly pages in my Hobonichi Weeks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Mostly brainstorming ways to make my work a little more efficient...</li>
<li>Also trying to brainstorm more concrete goals, but I have a tendency to work way more than I need to, so I'll probably try to cut back on pushing so many hours into my weekend.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reading, watching, &amp; playing</h2>
<ul>
<li>I've been reading through <em>Amitie and the Mysterious Egg</em> for Japanese learning and <em>The World Beyond Your Head: On Becoming An Individual in the Age of Distraction</em> by Matthew Crawford for &quot;fun&quot;.</li>
<li>I started watching <em>BanG Dream! It's MYGO!!!!!&quot;</em> and am pleasantly surprised at the directing quality. The music and art style are about as mediocre as I remember, though.</li>
<li>I <em>was</em> playing <em>Ensemble Stars!! Music</em> regularly until the recent event story. I won't get into the details, but I'm very disappointed at the company for this decision and I am unsure if I will continue dedicating time to it the same way I have the last 2-3 years.</li>
</ul>
