Wanted to attempt doing my version of [weeknotes](https://doingweeknotes.com/), but so I'll see if this is really useful or not... This was originally posted on my [mataroa](mataroa.blog) blog which I use for my professional life, but I realized I'd rather post them here. It gives me more of a reason to use neocities!

## Life
* Celebrated my birthday on December 27th. It was very lowkey, as usual with my family and my birthday being during the holidays.
* Got sick on December 30th with a sore throat. Slowly recovering as I write this, but it's really these unidentifiable things that get you!
* Doing a lot of New Year's cleaning and planning, still working out that yearly theme.
* Been successfully doing "one line a day" journaling for most days since December 30th. I'm trying a new [system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vEBBYJ1WBk&t=586s&pp=ygUTZG9wYW1pbmUgam91cm5hbGluZw%3D%3D) for my monthly pages in my Hobonichi Weeks.

## Work
* Mostly brainstorming ways to make my work a little more efficient...
* Also trying to brainstorm more concrete goals, but I have a tendency to work way more than I need to, so I'll probably try to cut back on pushing so many hours into my weekend.

## Reading, watching, & playing
* I've been reading through *Amitie and the Mysterious Egg* for Japanese learning and *The World Beyond Your Head: On Becoming An Individual in the Age of Distraction* by Matthew Crawford for "fun".
* I started watching *BanG Dream! It's MYGO!!!!!"* and am pleasantly surprised at the directing quality. The music and art style are about as mediocre as I remember, though.
* I *was* playing *Ensemble Stars!! Music* regularly until the recent event story. I won't get into the details, but I'm very disappointed at the company for this decision and I am unsure if I will continue dedicating time to it the same way I have the last 2-3 years.
