                <h2>what is this?</h2>
                <p>This page is about my personal boundaries as a person with OSDD and whatnot. It's inspired by this <a href="https://write.as/i9kkgvg5hp70gauw.md">plural etiquette questionnaire</a>. Some questions have been altered or removed if they're not applicable to me.</p>

                <hr>

                <h2>questions</h2>

                <ol>

                <li><p>How should people refer to you? <em>(should people address individual members whenever possible, or would you rather be referred to collectively, etc)</em></p></li>

                <blockquote>Collectively as "Eudiel" or "Eudae" is fine. A lot of people mess up and use the host's name as a collective name when they learn it, and I don't really like this.</blockquote>

                <li><p>What terms do you prefer for referring to yourselves as individuals <em>(headmate/alter/system member/...)</em>, or as a group <em>(system/collective/household/...)</em>? Is there any other terminology for yourselves or aspects of your experience that you use and want people to know, or that you dislike and want people to avoid when talking about you?</p></li>
                <blockquote>I'm very comfortable using medical terminology for myself so 'system' and 'alter' are both fine. Headmate is okay, system member is also okay. I highly prefer the term "multiple" over "plural".</blockquote>

                <li><p>Who in your system are people most likely to interact with? <em>(names, pronouns, short Twitter-esque bios, etc)</em></p></li>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>&#128026 - ey/him, the host and the one driving most daily activities.</p>
                  <p>&#129344 - she/its, the cohost and usually copiloting the body.</p>
                  <p>&#128013 - he/her, frontrunner. Asocial hardass who probably will not talk to you first.</p>
                  <p>&#9986 - he/it, frontrunner/protector. Been scarce lately but broody teenager who surprisingly loves talking to people.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <li><p>What should people do if they don't know who's at front?</p></li>
                <blockquote>
                  Treat us like one person. It's less hassle. We have ways to telegraph to closer friends, so if you don't know who's fronting, you're not supposed to know.
                </blockquote>

                <li><p>If someone talks to one of you, will other system members be aware of the conversation? Will they be actively watching, or just able to remember it later?</p></li>
                <blockquote>
                  They will be able to remember it and we are generally co-conscious most of the time.
                </blockquote>

                <li><p>Do you have any internal communication difficulties, memory issues, switch triggers, etc that others should be mindful of?</p></li>
                    <blockquote>
                      Memory is <em>generally</em> fine but we have emotional amnesia and sometimes struggle to remember specific events. If we say we don't remember something, then we don't remember it.
                    </blockquote>

                <li><p>Your stance on being asked questions? <em>(about personal experience, preferences, plurality in general, etc)</em></p></li>
                <blockquote>
                  Generally dislike this because we're very private. IF we want you to know more then you will learn more.
                </blockquote>
              </ol>
