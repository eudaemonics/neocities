          <h2>Spoiler Warning</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>MAJOR SPOILER WARNING FOR <em>IN STARS AND TIME</em> ACTS 2 AND EARLY ACT 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So this is another collection of theories and thoughts on <em>In Stars and Time</em>. As said above...this will have spoilers for up to the end of Act 2 and some of Act 3. A lot of this is based on things I've pointed out to my partner while streaming the game.</p>
<p>For the record: I had <em>some</em> familiarity with the game's content before starting but I've never really looked into the story or paid much attention to what showed up on social media.  Without further ado...</p>
<h2>Siffrin's Origins and the Vanishing Island</h2>
<p>So one of the main, big theories I've given to my partner is that I think Siffrin and the King are from the country that vanished to the north(?) of Vaugarde semi-recently.</p>
<p>A lot of things associated with this nation have to do with the sky, space, stars, and light. Here is what I can remember off the top of my head:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the children in Dormont asking if Siffrin is from the sky and giving him the 4-pointed leaf (a star, which looks familiar)</li>
<li>Siffrin saying that he wants his ashes to be thrown up to the sky or put on the highest mountain peak.</li>
<li>The star motifs associated with the King and Siffrin (and additionally Loop)</li>
<li>Siffrin's expressions are related to stars and light.
<ul>
<li>Additionally they remember what &quot;Colors&quot; are and ...colors are reflections of light... ...</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The gates in the house having motifs related to 4-pointed stars.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think since no one can remember the name of this place, its language, its people, it has to have had some massive ripple effect that resulted in Siffrin's memory loss/general trauma and why the King feels like he's obligated to &quot;preserve&quot; Vaugarde for ...himself? Others? It's hard to say.</p>
<p>I think it's more complicated than that, obviously, because Euphrasie asks Siffrin specifically to fix what is &quot;rotting&quot;. I don't know if it will really have anything to do with his lost eye, because that was so recent, but I feel like they're drawing more attention to it the more I get into the story. Though I've thus far chalked this up to just... emphasizing how much Siffrin doesn't recognize himself as a person/individual and is so afraid of asking for help and being emotionally vulnerable.</p>
<h3>Siffrin &amp; the King's Religion</h3>
<p>I noticed that the &quot;Universe&quot; was capitalized when Loop talks about how they're a star, which is part of the Universe, which encompasses everything.</p>
<p>The concept of Change in Vaugardian religion feels so foreign to Siffrin because, in my opinion, it goes against the concept of the Universe which feels more like an abstract will you have to go along with rather than an active religion where you can play a role in it. A religion with such a strong focus on your locus of control wouldn't compute to Siffrin, who barely recognizes his own individuality.</p>
<h3>The Lost Nation &amp; Vaugarde</h3>
<p>I also think this vanishing nation and Vaugarde had some sort of strong relationship. I'm mostly thinking of the book in the secret library about the tree with stars on it with the unreadable language...and how that relates to the Favor Tree--where you first met Loop.</p>
<p>I think...this is a bit of a cultural exchange thing. It's become Vaugardian as the Favor Tree is an established cultural belief, but I feel like wishing...beneath the biggest tree...which reaches up the highest to the heavens/space/stars...is significant.</p>
<p>Also I'm paying attention to all characters with white hair now. I feel like Euphrasie might have some roots from the vanishing nation (so she's like, half Vaugardian) but who knows. Her name is French (aka Vaugardian) though so who knows.</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I think Loop is an earlier timeline version of Siffrin and might've been trapped by the King if he made some stupid mistake in an earlier timeline. One of the first things I noticed about Loop and Siffrin were they had similar eye shapes so like. Here:
<img src="https://i.postimg.cc/gj4N3vyM/image.png" alt="A screenshot of Siffrin from the game In Stars and Time. He's shouting and his eyes are wide."> <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/d1jBK8fq/image.png" alt="A screenshot of Loop from the game In Stars and Time. They're making a distressed expression and their eyes are wide."></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Odile might be studying something along the lines of what constitutes a family and the different types of family in different cultures. I feel like this might have to do with her not having a family of her own? Sorry she's like the one character I'm biased to besides Mirabelle right now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The loss of Siffrin's eye probably had a ripple effect as well but I genuinely can't pinpoint it right now.</p>
</li>
</ul>
