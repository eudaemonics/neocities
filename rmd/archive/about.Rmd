Hi there, this is just my space on the Internet. I'm a multiple and otherkin/therian thing that just wanted to try making a site for fun. I launched this site in 2022 one night when I was procrastinating on a homework assignment.

I'm mostly interested in academia and want to become a psychology researcher and educator. My interests are mostly on digital communication, informatics, and sociopsyschology. This site's current iteration was primarily written in RStudio ~~because I'm a masochist~~ because I worked a lot with it for my schooling and feel comfortable editing markdown documents. I have a blog post about how I used its native SSG to write this site [here](diary/rmarkdown-ssg.html). At some point I want to learn more complex computer languages, but for now I'm just pretending to be a computer nerd. This site was actually supposed to have a 3-column layout, but it looked ugly no matter what...? So we're stuck like this.

I consider myself to be a weird multimedia artist. I enjoy making digital and traditional art and writing short stories ~~and sometimes fanfiction~~ on occasion. At some point my writing will go on this site when I figure out how I want to display it.

In terms of media interests, I really like the ''Puyo Puyo'' franchise and it's been my special interest for almost 10 years at this point. I have eclectic taste in anime and manga, but I'm fond of the fantasy genre and most of what I watch gravitates towards that genre. I also read a lot of mystery/detective novel fiction and I'm currently reading through a lot of [honkaku and shin honkaku](https://crimereads.com/the-honkaku-and-shin-honkaku-mysteries-of-seishi-yokomizo/) mystery classics as more are being translated into English.

When I'm not doing stereotypical geek activities, I like to hike, cook, and play violin.
