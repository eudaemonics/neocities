This part of my site is less like a "blog" and more like a "brain dump" since I feel pretty strongly about [btxx's concept of making a "brain dump" in lieu of a "blog"](https://btxx.org/posts/dump/). I also used to host this on [zonelets](https://zonelets.net/) with the static generator [zoner](https://ryantrawick.itch.io/zoner), but I write everything in Rmd format right now.

Older posts are longer form and more formal since I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do with this part of my site, but I've moved to using it more casually to expand on random ideas... Don't take me too seriously.
