This part of my site is less like a blog and more like a "brain dump" honestly. I feel pretty strongly about [ btxx's concept of making a "brain dump" in lieu of a "blog"](https://btxx.org/posts/dump/). Older posts are longer form and more formal since I wasn't really sure what I wanted to do with this part of my site, but I've moved to using it more casually to expand on random ideas...
