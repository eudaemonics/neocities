## 2024
**February 29, 2024:** Transitioned from brackets to RStudio since I'm more comfortable with this environment. Got rid of the markdown dimension since clearly it didn't help me post more.  

## 2023
**February 6, 2023:** The big return! I've added a few pages and added a new blog post. Check out resources, links, and the markdown dimension!  

## 2022
**June 6, 2022:** Gave everything a bit of a facelift, styled the diary page and made the site a bit more natural to read!  
**June 5, 2022:** Diary page added  
**May 23, 2022:** About page added  
**May 22, 2022:** Site landing page launched
