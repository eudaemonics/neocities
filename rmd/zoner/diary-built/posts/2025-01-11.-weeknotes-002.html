<h1>Weeknotes 002</h1>
<h4>11 January 2025</h4>
<p>Not much to talk about this week. I was doing a lot of personal reflection that's most likely better suited for a longer form blog post.</p>
<h2>Life</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dealing with the fires in my area.</li>
<li>Still in search of a good life-balance. I haven't been exercising as much as I'd like because of the aforementioned fires.</li>
<li>Hung out with a few friends this week to watch some <em>Precure</em>. Rewatching the <em>Star Twinkle Precure</em> movie with everyone was a delight. I cried again.</li>
<li>Still thinking a lot about how the hunch that I had OCPD when I was a teenager is actually probably true. I've been doing a lot of reflecting by listening to <a href="https://thehealthycompulsive.com">The Healthy Compulsive Project</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Work</h2>
<ul>
<li>Work-life balance is hard as said before. I think the good thing is that having to make a clear work schedule really forces me to use the weekends for rest.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reading, watching, &amp; playing</h2>
<ul>
<li>Still reading <em>Amitie and the Mysterious Egg</em> for Japanese learning and <em>The World Beyond Your Head: On Becoming An Individual in the Age of Distraction</em> by Matthew Crawford.</li>
<li>Finished binging <em>BanG Dream! It's MyGO!!!!!</em> with my partner and really enjoyed it as a season. I'm surprised at how much BanG Dream has branched out, but I wonder why it's decided to do that.</li>
<li>Started watching BanG Dream! Ave Mujica: The Die is Cast with my partner as well.</li>
</ul>
