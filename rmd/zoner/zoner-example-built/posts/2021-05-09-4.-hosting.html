<h1>4. Hosting</h1>
<h4>9 May 2021</h4>
<p></p>
<p>So, you've written your blog. Now it's time to put it out there and let the world read it! Hosting a website is easier than ever these days. For a small blog there are many free options.</p>
<h2><a href="https://neocities.org/">Neocities</a></h2>
<p>Neocities is what I used for this site. It's super user-friendly, hassle-free, and it has a community feature that makes it easy to find and connect with other blogs. Almost like building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring">webring</a>.</p>
<p>For a small price you can put your site on your own domain name with full SSL certification. Otherwise your site is appened with <code>neocities</code>, as seen above.</p>
<h2><a href="https://surge.sh/">Surge</a></h2>
<p>Surge is a pretty neat command line tool. It lets you take a folder and push it to their platform right away. Pretty perfect for a Zoner built folder. It does require some techinical knowledge though.</p>
<p>It's entirely free if you don't mind having your site on their domain in the url bar, similar to Neocities and Tumblr. There's also a cheap paid option to use your own domain name, also similar to Neocities.</p>
<h2><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a></h2>
<p>GitHub/Microsoft works with ICE, so that's a bit yikes. But Pages is a decent free service. Also requires some technical knowledge of how git works in general.</p>
<p>You can use your own domain name for free but I don't think you can have SSL certification with it.</p>

<p>That's about it I think. I hope Zoner helps you express yourself and write wonderful things that enrich the world. Have fun!</p>
