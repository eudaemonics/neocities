Wow. I forgot to actually post weeknotes. Well I'm not putting pressure on myself to do this *every* week especially if I get busy so I should cut myself some slack. My friend [Acy](https://acyfactory.com/) also started weeknotes because of me so I'd say everyone is better off following her instead of me haha

## Life
- I bought a new car, so I have a billion phone calls to make this week about car insurance. 
- Still waiting to hear back on my graduate school application... I'm planning to reach out on LinkedIn to do some informational interviews this week with other people in the master's program I'm hoping to get into though...
- I have to get an onlay done on one of my teeth (hooray...) and I'm sitting here drinking boba. Good life decisions only in here.
- I earned my data analysis certificate a few weeks ago! I'm starting the Google certified one today.

## Learning (NEW!)
- I'm looking into a couple different CMS or SSG type things because honestly I really don't like working with HTML files anymore. Sue me. I'm mostly looking into [lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/) currently.
- Trying out the [portableapps](https://portableapps.com/) software so I can write things on different devices with just my USB drive since I have 2 primary ones I use at home. Also trying out [Zettlr](https://zettlr.com/) which is available on portable apps.

## Creating
- I've been slowly writing a *Dramatica Act 4* fanfic and I got some *amazing* feedback from my wonderful friends after we started doing a weekly share of creative projects every week. I'm hopefully going to start actually implementing their edits this week since I've been busy wtih femslash February.
- I wrote two fics for Femslash February, one for *[Project Sekai](https://archiveofourown.org/works/62700553)* with queerplatonic Kanade/Mafuyu and another for *[Dramatica Act 4](https://archiveofourown.org/works/62708761)* with Alice and the nameless girl from the play. I'm especially proud of the latter. I'll probably have these on my website at some point for my reference.
- Kind of drawing/sketching on sticky notes in my spare time but I am trying to be okay with letting my visual art lie fallow, I guess. I want to do some needle felting this month though.

## Reading, watching, & playing
- I've been playing a lot of *Fields of Mistria* lately when I'm home. 
- When I'm on the go, I started playing *Stardew Valley* on my PS Vita because it's become my favorite little emulation machine. Unfortunately *Fields of Mistria* has a billion QoL improvements that has made playing vanilla *Stardew Valley* this massive chore in my mind.
