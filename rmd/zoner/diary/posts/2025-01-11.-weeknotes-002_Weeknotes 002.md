Not much to talk about this week. I was doing a lot of personal reflection that's most likely better suited for a longer form blog post.
## Life
- Dealing with the fires in my area.
- Still in search of a good life-balance. I haven't been exercising as much as I'd like because of the aforementioned fires.
- Hung out with a few friends this week to watch some *Precure*. Rewatching the *Star Twinkle Precure* movie with everyone was a delight. I cried again.
- Still thinking a lot about how the hunch that I had OCPD when I was a teenager is actually probably true. I've been doing a lot of reflecting by listening to [The Healthy Compulsive Project](https://thehealthycompulsive.com)

## Work
- Work-life balance is hard as said before. I think the good thing is that having to make a clear work schedule really forces me to use the weekends for rest.

## Reading, watching, & playing
- Still reading *Amitie and the Mysterious Egg* for Japanese learning and *The World Beyond Your Head: On Becoming An Individual in the Age of Distraction* by Matthew Crawford.
- Finished binging *BanG Dream! It's MyGO!!!!!* with my partner and really enjoyed it as a season. I'm surprised at how much BanG Dream has branched out, but I wonder why it's decided to do that.
- Started watching BanG Dream! Ave Mujica: The Die is Cast with my partner as well.
