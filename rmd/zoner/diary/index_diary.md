# the diary.

This part of my site is less like a "blog" and more like a "brain dump" since I feel pretty strongly about [btxx's concept of making a "brain dump" in lieu of a "blog"](https://btxx.org/posts/dump/).

As such, I call this a diary and each blog post is more like an entry since this is intended to be somewhat personal.

## recent entries.

<!-- An <archive> tag with a count attribute will show that count of the most recent posts! For a "more posts" button add a more attribute with your archive link. -->

<archive count="4" more="./archive"></archive>

<!-- The "more posts" button will not appear if there are fewer or equal posts to the count attribute. -->
