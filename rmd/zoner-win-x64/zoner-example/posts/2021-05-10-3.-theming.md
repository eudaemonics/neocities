<style>fantasy</style>

Zoner uses the same CSS class names and ids as Zonelets, so any Zonelets theme automatically works!

Check out the [Theme Gallery](https://zonelets.net/posts/2020-11-08-Theme-Gallery.html) on Zonelets to see what's possible.

If you want to use a different theme on a page, like this one does, you can add a `<style>` tag and put the name of a style sheet in your `/style` folder, like so:

`<style>fantasy</style>`

Zoner will then replace that page's style with the one you asked for, just make sure it exists in the style directory!

## Archives

This is a pretty short post, so I guess I'll also explain how generating an archive works:

In most blogs you'll want an archive page so users can see everything you've written. That's what the `<archive>` tag is for. Zoner will find this tag and fill it in with a list of your posts.

But you may also want a recent posts list on your home page, you don't want it to be super long though. No worries! Add a `count` and `more` attribute to the tag like so:

`<archive count="2" more="./archive"></archive>`

This will generate this:

<archive count="2" more="./archive"></archive>

`count` is how many posts will be displayed, if it's greater or equal to the current post count a "more posts" link will not appear. `more` is the link to your archive page, which is required if you limit your count.
