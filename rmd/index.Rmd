**updates**

**April 22, 2024:** New [blog post](diary/gdocs-blog.html) about blogging in lieu of using Google Docs for important and interesting posts. RStudio continues to break my special symbols, so the site looks a bit weird right now.

**March 3, 2024:** Wrote up a [blog](diary/rmarkdown-ssg.html) about making this site with rmarkdown's native SSG. Also added the [webdev](webdev.html) and [links](links.html) page.

**March 1, 2024:** New [blog post](diary/2024-themes.html) about this year and my absence.

*Past updates can be seen [here](updates.html).*

### to-do
* Redo my stylesheet...
* Downsize some of my images and change them from PNG to JPG
* Work on sitemap.
* Look into installing giscus.
* Write more blog posts and book reviews.
* Start looking into blogdown...?
* Figure out how to organize a /library or /bookshelf page.
* Do some more fun experiments.

## welcome
This site functions as a personal archive for my works, my interests and shrines, as well as a creative exercise as I explore the world of static web coding.

As of March 2024, I mostly use RStudio to generate my HTML. It makes my life a lot easier in terms of testing and content control. I am currently working to make this site as responsive as possible, but please forgive any mistakes...I'm aware display on mobile is very borked. 

My aim is to create an accessible site regardless of device, especially as [most internet users access the internet through a mobile device.](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/mobile-internet-traffic#percentage-of-mobile-traffic)
