**updates**

**March 3, 2024:** Wrote up a [blog](diary/rmarkdown-ssg.html) about making this site with rmarkdown's native SSG.

**March 1, 2024:** New [blog post](diary/2024-themes.html) about this year and my absence.

**February 29, 2024:** Transitioned from brackets to RStudio since I'm more comfortable with this environment. Got rid of the markdown dimension since clearly it didn't help me post more.  

*Past updates can be seen [here](updates.html).*

### to-do
* Redo my stylesheet.
* Work on my gallery the R library pixture.
* Write more blog posts and book reviews.
* Maybe a blog post about making a site in R?
* Update the diary pages to RMD.

## welcome
This site functions as a personal archive for my works, my interests and shrines, as well as a creative exercise as I explore the world of static web coding.

As of March 2024, I mostly use RStudio to generate my HTML. It makes my life a lot easier in terms of testing and content control. I am currently working to make this site as responsive as possible, but please forgive any mistakes...I'm aware display on mobile is very borked. 

My aim is to create an accessible site regardless of device, as I believe that making your site only navigable on desktop is classist and ableist, especially as [most internet users access the internet through a mobile device.](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/mobile-internet-traffic#percentage-of-mobile-traffic)
