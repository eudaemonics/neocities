As I've gotten older, I have a harder and harder time figuring out what to write on these about pages, honestly. Probably because I feel like these about pages become outdated super quickly... I started this site in ~2022 as a place to store some of my ramblings and art and learn more about CSS/HTMl. 

I'm mostly interested in academia and want to become a psychology researcher and educator. My interests are mostly on digital communication, informatics, and sociopsyschology. This site's current iteration was primarily written in RStudio ~~because I'm a masochist~~ because I worked a lot with it for my schooling and feel comfortable editing markdown documents. I have a blog post about how I used its native SSG to write this site [here](diary/rmarkdown-ssg.html).

In terms of media interests, I really like the ''Puyo Puyo'' franchise and I have eclectic taste in anime and manga, and I read a lot of mystery/detective novel fiction.
