**Welcome to The Markdown Dimension!**

What the heck is this?
===

Hello there! Yeah, I know, this part of my site is pretty plain jane compared to the rest of it. This is part of a personal pet project where I make webpages using the Markdown language. I'm using the tool [MarkDeep](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep) to format this and create the page that you're viewing right now.

You can take a look at this page without its formatting right [here](?noformat)!

Why markdown?
===
Why not? 

The real answer is that: Markdown is pretty good for whatever attention problems I have going on. I use it pretty frequently on Discord and even at school since it's how I take notes. Meanwhile I make a lot of errors in my HTML code because I dislike going through and debugging it and re-reading it over and over again, all the opening and closing tags don't help either.
I wanted to prove that you could make a website with the most simple tools available and without any coding knowledge, so I wanted to try this out! I'm even typing this out in plain Notepad++, though I did have a few other IDEs at my disposal. Notepad++ is just the most distraction free.
I'm also, honestly, pretty busy. It doesn't leave me much time to update the site, but I still want to put stuff up! So lightweight Markdown files that I can write easily without stressing myself out are pretty great.

Okay, what's in this part of the site?
===

Mostly whatever strikes my fancy. Currently, it's a collection of some Japanese to English translation stuff I've done and miscellaneous writing projects.

Sounds cool! How do I make something like this?
===
I'm planning to write up a guide for Markdown sites in the future.  Those will be slightly more involved than Markdeep, since Markdeep is really just a script plugin and you can read how to make a [similar site to this one](https://casual-effects.com/markdeep/#getstarted) here. I'll have a guide written up for Jekyll and other "lightweight" sites up soon.
